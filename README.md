Renewable Products Magento Plugin v.4.1.0
============================

This plugin is an official and stable version of the Renewable Products Magento extension. It bundles functionality to process Configurable Products renewals securely as well as send email notifications to your customers when they complete a successful purchase all in all allowing your end-users the ability to take advantage of the renewal special price previously setup by the site admin.

Don't worry about managing the renewals over the phone any more for each order, or trying to pull your hair by trying to figure out who needs to renew their licenses, this magento plugin will automatically add products individually from each end-user order to the magento Admin section under ‘Renewable Products’ where the renewable product manager will just keep track of new individual products with ‘renewable’ attributes as they flood in, and fill in the required blank areas, in order for your end-users to be flagged as to where they may renewal or what is the status of each renewable product license expiration time frame, all that, made possible by just making sure to properly configure your configurable products’ attributes once.
